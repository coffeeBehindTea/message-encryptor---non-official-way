# message-encryptor---non-official-way

this is a fake encryptor. It is enough for daly encryption, but useless when facing someone know programming.

# how
the encryptor requires a encryption seed for encrytion.
program will multiply encryption seed by the power of 10 and get a huge number.
then, number at each digit will be the position of one character of your message.

after that, programm will add some totally meanningless content in order to confuse other.

# decrypt
